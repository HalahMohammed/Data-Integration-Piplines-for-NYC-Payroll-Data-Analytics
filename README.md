# Data-Integration-Piplines-for-NYC-Payroll-Data-Analytics
I'm building an automated Azure data pipeline (ADF, Synapse, SQL DB, Data Lake) to process NYC payroll CSVs. It transforms raw data into a clean analytics warehouse, enabling analysis of city overtime spending and providing public transparency on budget allocation. The solution is dynamic, monitored, and production-ready.
